# Godot Icons Browser

This is a simple tool to browse the icons available in the Godot Engine. It is useful to find the name of an icon to use in your project/addon.

You can search for icons by name, and get the SVG, or the GDScript code to use the icon in your project.

All icons are from Godot 4.2.
